# CS and Math Study Group

A collaborative study group focused on computer science and mathematics, featuring rotating presenters, weekly sessions, and hands-on projects.

## Overview

This repository contains materials for our ongoing CS and Math study group, including lecture slides, example code, and project materials. Our goal is to create a sustainable, long-term learning environment where participants can both teach and learn from each other across various technical domains.

## Core Topics

### Mathematics
- Calculus (Basic through Advanced)
- Linear Algebra
- Discrete Mathematics
- Differential Equations
- Probability (Calculus-based and Discrete)
- Graph Theory
- Numerical Analysis
- Linear Programming

### Computer Science
- Algorithms
  - Search and Sorting
  - Graph Algorithms
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Parallel Programming
  - Tree-based Algorithms
- Computer Architecture & Operating Systems
- Programming Language Theory
 
### Physics
- Calculus-Based Physics
- Physics Simulations
  - Electrical Systems
  - Acoustics
- Computational Physics
- Applied Physics Problems

### Primary Programming Languages
Study materials and examples will be provided in the following languages:
- C/C++ (Systems programming, algorithms)
- Python (Scientific computing, general-purpose)
- R (Statistical analysis, data science)
- SQL (Database operations)
- Assembly (TO BE DECIDED, system-level programming)

## Study Group Structure

### Session Format
- Weekly meetings (schedule determined via group availability)
- Rotating presenters and topics
- Combination of lectures, hands-on problems, and projects
- 6-week "terms" focused on specific topic areas
- Optional monthly research paper discussions from arxiv.org

### Materials
- Lecture slides (PDF format)
- Example code
- Practice problems
- Project assignments
- Supplementary reading materials
